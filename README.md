1. Utilizing too large of a protein region in CNNs will introduce noise which is why most models are limited by their small size, but would filters used for image data also work on graphs in this case since their connections are similar.

2. How does the choice of histone marks, particularly the six core marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac), influence the performance and interpretability of both classification and regression tasks in predicting gene expression levels, and how do these results compare with previous studies using the ChromHMM model?
