1. Utilizing too large of a protein region in CNNs will introduce noise which is why most models are limited by their small size, but would filters used for image data also work on graphs in this case since their connections are similar.

2. How can GNNExplainer and GC-MERGE models be applied to different cell lines and gene expression groups (high, moderate, and low) in the future to explore tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms and identify critical histone marks and long-range genomic interactions in other biological contexts?

3. How do we optimize the hyperparameters for aggregation function or number of iterations (K) for performance? How does understanding important histone markers for highly expressive genes translate to breakthroughs in medical or drug discovery?
